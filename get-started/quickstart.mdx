<Steps>
  <Step title="⏫ Upgrade to Sectors Standard or Professional">
    Through the Sectors API, you are two lines of code away from Indonesia's most comprehensive financial market data and stock research tools. 
    Sectors API is available to our [Standard and Professional plans](https://sectors.app/pricing) subscribers.

  </Step>
  <Step title="🗝️ Obtain Sectors API Key">
    Once [logged in](https://sectors.app/auth) with your Sectors account (Standard or Professional plan), navigate to the API Keys section in the [API page](https://sectors.app/api) to generate a new API key. 
    Include this API key in the header of your requests to authenticate and access the API (code snippets provided in the next step).

  </Step>
  <Step title="📊 Retrieve Data from the API">
    Use one of the documented API endpoints along with your Sectors API Key to access data from Sectors. 
    Explore the [API References](../api-references) to discover the available endpoints and sample responses.

    ```python Python
    import requests

    # Replace the URL with a URL from the API References
    url = "https://api.sectors.app/v1/.../"
    api_key = "API key acquired from the previous step"
    headers = {"Authorization": api_key}

    try:
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        data = response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as err:
        raise SystemExit(err)
    ```

    ```js JavaScript
    // Replace the URL with a URL from the API References
    const url = "https://api.sectors.app/v1/.../"
    const api_key = "API key acquired from the previous step"
    const options = {method: 'GET', headers: {Authorization: api_key}};

    fetch(url, options)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(response => console.log(response))
      .catch(err => console.error(err));
    ```

    ```r R
    library(httr)
    library(jsonlite)

    # Replace the URL with a URL from the API References
    url <- "https://api.sectors.app/v1/.../"
    api_key <- "API key acquired from the previous step"
    headers <- c(Authorization = api_key)

    data <- GET(url, add_headers(headers))

    df <- fromJSON(content(data, "text", encoding="utf-8"),flatten=TRUE)
    ```
