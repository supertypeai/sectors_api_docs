## Overview

Sectors has been used as an equity research tool by Indonesia's top financial institutions, and has also been used as a data source for academic research.
The depth of our data puts it head and shoulders above any comparable market intelligence tool, and is readily available through a simple developer experience with Sectors Financial API.

Beginners can start with our [Quickstart](./quickstart) guide, while more experienced developers can dive into our [API Reference](../../api-references/v2/companies) for a comprehensive list of endpoints and examples.

We also have longer-form tutorial series and recipes for those looking to build financial analysis workflows and automations by example.
