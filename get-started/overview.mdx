## Overview

Sectors has been used as an equity research tool by Indonesia's top financial institutions, and has also been used as a data source for academic research.
The depth of our data puts it head and shoulders above any comparable market intelligence tool, and is readily available through a simple developer experience with Sectors Financial API.

Beginners can start with the [Get your API Key](#get-your-api-key) guide, while more experienced developers can dive into our [API Reference](../api-references/helper-list/subsectors) for a comprehensive list of endpoints and examples.

For practical, end-to-end use cases, explore our [Recipes](../recipes), which showcase real-world examples of how to use the API. If you’re interested in advanced applications, the [Generative AI Series](../recipes/generative-ai-python) demonstrates how the API can be integrated into generative AI workflows. 

You can also join our [Community on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/TAnZMmNS4X) to ask questions, share ideas, and get help from other developers.

  </Step>
  <Step title="📊 Retrieve Data from the API">
    Use one of the documented API endpoints along with your Sectors Financial API Key to access data from Sectors. 
    Explore the [API References](../api-references/helper-list/subsectors) to discover the available endpoints and sample responses.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    import requests

    # Replace the URL with a URL from the API References
    url = "https://api.sectors.app/v1/.../"
    api_key = "API key acquired from the previous step"
    headers = {"Authorization": api_key}

    try:
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        data = response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as err:
        raise SystemExit(err)
    ```

    ```js JavaScript
    // Replace the URL with a URL from the API References
    const url = "https://api.sectors.app/v1/.../"
    const api_key = "API key acquired from the previous step"
    const options = {method: 'GET', headers: {Authorization: api_key}};

    fetch(url, options)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(response => console.log(response))
      .catch(err => console.error(err));
    ```

    ```r R
    library(httr)
    library(jsonlite)

    # Replace the URL with a URL from the API References
    url <- "https://api.sectors.app/v1/.../"
    api_key <- "API key acquired from the previous step"
    headers <- c(Authorization = api_key)

    data <- GET(url, add_headers(headers))

    df <- fromJSON(content(data, "text", encoding="utf-8"),flatten=TRUE)
    ```
