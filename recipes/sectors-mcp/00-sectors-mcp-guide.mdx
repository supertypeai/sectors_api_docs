## **Getting Started**

Before you can utilize the server, you'll need to set it up.

### **Prerequisites:**

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager, usually comes with Node.js)
- You need a Sectors API Key to use this server. You can get it from [Sectors API](https://sectors.app/api).

### **Installation Steps:**

1. Clone the Repository:  
   If you haven't already, get the server's source code here: [https://github.com/supertypeai/sectors-mcp.git](https://github.com/supertypeai/sectors-mcp.git). Or directly use git clone command.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/supertypeai/sectors-mcp.git
   ```
2. Install Dependencies:  
   Navigate to the cloned directory in your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   cd sectors-mcp
   npm install
   ```

   This command downloads and installs all the necessary packages the server relies on.

3. Build the Project:  
   After the dependencies are installed, build the server by running:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript that can be run by Node.js.

### **Configuration:**

The server requires API credentials to access its data sources. You can fill the API Key in the MCP config file in the command line. Or if you want to extend the use of this MCP and test it with other tools, you can fill the API Key in the .env file.

_**Note:**_ If you fill the API Key in the MCP config file, you can skip the .env file.

### For MCP Client that use MCP config file

You can find the MCP config file for your MCP client in the MCP client's documentation. In this tutorial we use [Windsurf MCP Client](https://codeium.com/windsurf/mcp). You can find the MCP config file in the .codeium\windsurf\mcp_config.json file.

Write this into your MCP config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sectors-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["Path\toyourproject\buildindex.js"],
      "env": {
        "SECTORS_API_KEY": "your_api_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### For MCP Client that use .env file

1. Create a file named .env in the root directory of the project.
2. Add the following lines to this .env file, replacing your_api_base_url and your_api_key with the actual credentials:

```bash
SECTORS_API_BASE=your_api_base_url
SECTORS_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

### **Interacting with an MCP Client:**

Now you can interact with the Sectors API in your MCP Client. All the examples provided is using Windsurf Code Editor. But it should work the same for other MCP Clients.

Let's try some prompt as examples:

**1. Fetch Companies Under Banks Subsector**

![sectors-mcp-recipe01](./images/sectors-mcp-recipe01.png)

You can see that Windsurf call the fetch-companies-by-subsector tool with the subsector name "banks" and return the response in a chat message.

**2. Multiple Tools in a Prompt**

![sectors-mcp-recipe02](./images/sectors-mcp-recipe02.png)

You can see that Windsurf call multiple tools in a prompt. It call the fetch-top-companies based on Banks subsector and then it call the fetch-company-report for the company in the list.
