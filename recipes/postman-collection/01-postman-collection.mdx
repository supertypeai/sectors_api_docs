Welcome to the **Sectors Financial API** documentation! This guide is designed to help developers and integrators get started with our API, which provides market and analytical data specific to Indonesia. Whether you're building financial applications, conducting market research, or integrating data into your platform, this API will provide you with the tools you need.

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through how to use our **Postman Collection** to explore and test our API endpoints.

## Introduction

The **Sectors Financial API** offers a wide range of financial and analytical data for the Indonesian market. You can access real-time stock prices, historical data, market trends, and more. To make it easier for developers to interact with our API, we have created a **Postman Collection** that contains all the necessary endpoints and example requests.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Postman**: Download and install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) if you haven't already.
- **API Key**: You will need an API key to authenticate your requests. If you don't have one, please go to [Sectors Financial API](https://sectors.app/api) to generate API key for your account.
- **Basic Knowledge of APIs**: Familiarity with RESTful APIs and JSON formats is recommended.

## Getting Started with Postman

Postman is a powerful tool for testing and interacting with APIs. It allows you to send HTTP requests, view responses, and organize your API calls into collections.

If you're new to Postman, check out their official [documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/) to get familiar with the interface.

## Using Variables

The collection uses variables to make it reusable and customizable. There are two types of variables:

1. **Collection Variables**: These are shared across all requests in the collection. Examples include:

   - `{{environment}}`: The base URL for the API (default data: https://api.sectors.app).
   - `{{apikey}}`: Your API key (replace this with your own key).
   - `{{ticker}}`: The stock ticker symbol (e.g., `AAPL`).

2. **Request-Specific Variables**: Some parameters are unique to specific requests and are defined within the request itself. For example:
   - `{{report_date}}`: The report date for financial data (e.g., `2023-09-30`).
